# Chat App

Welcome to the Chat App! This project is a simple chat application built with React.

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Install dependencies by running `npm install`.
4. Start the development server by running `npm start`.
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the app.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. See the [running tests documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. Your app is now ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project and copy all configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project. You'll have full control over them. At this point, you're on your own.
